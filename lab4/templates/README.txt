I used input[type=range] for the sliders, which are rather difficult to style for cross browser support.  I initially created it in Chrome so that's where it looks the best. Firefox looks decent after a bit of hacking, but it is not how i intended it to look. Latest IE looks fine except for the range inputs.

Firefox (and in some cases Chrome) appears to be a bit buggy with the background animations. It glitches when you hover the widget. Don't blame me, the syntax is correct.

I'm still not fully satisfied with the loading animation. Feel free to fork it and see if you can give it a better flow, or suggest improvements.
